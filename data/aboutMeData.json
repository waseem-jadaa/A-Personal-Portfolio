    "aboutMe":"Software Developer with a full-stack mindset. I'm passionate about building clean and efficient applications, whether it's optimizing a React front-end to run 30% faster or designing robust RESTful APIs with Java and Spring Boot. I enjoy solving real-world problems and turning complex ideas—like an AI-powered employment platform (my graduation project, FursaPal)—into reality. I'm a collaborative team player and a continuous learner, always excited for the next technical challenge.",
